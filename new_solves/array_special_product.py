'''
Store the product of all the elements is a variable and then iterate the array and add product/current_index_value in a new array. and then return this new array.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:a
'''
def productExceptSelf(a, n):
     
    prod = 1
    flag = 0
     
    for i in range(n):

        # which have value
        # 0
        if (a[i] == 0):
            flag += 1
        else:
            prod *= a[i]
     
    # Creating a new array of size n
    arr = [0 for i in range(n)]
     
    for i in range(n):
         
        # If number of elements in
        # array with value 0
        # is more than 1 than each
        # value in new array
        # will be equal to 0
        if (flag > 1):
            arr[i] = 0
         
        # If no element having value
        # 0 than we will
        # insert product/a[i] in new array
        elif (flag == 0):
            arr[i] = (prod // a[i])
         
        # If 1 element of array having
        # value 0 than all
        # the elements except that index
        # value , will be
        # equal to 0
        elif (flag == 1 and a[i] != 0):
            arr[i] = 0
         
        # If(flag == 1 && a[i] == 0)
        else:
            arr[i] = prod
